# Abby fit for cricket app
An app that serves up a daily routine of strengthening exercises and suggested workouts.

# Project description
This is a Streamlit web app written in Python 3.8.10. It\'s intended purely for one cricketer\'s use and serves them up a daily random selection of strength exercises to do that day along with a suggested flexibility or gym workout.<br>
Basically all it does is pick 6 exercises at random each run from a pandas dataframe containing 20 possibilities and serves those up to the user, along with YouTube videos showing how to perform each exercise. Below that is longer flexibility or gym workout, again as a follow along video culled off YouTube.<br>
The project has been built in Streamlit V1.31.1 and distributed as a public app on the Streamlit Community Cloud.<br>
There are no plans to develop or update the app. Copy the code and adapt if freely for your personal needs if it would be useful to you.<br>
